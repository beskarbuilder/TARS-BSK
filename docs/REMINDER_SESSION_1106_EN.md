**// TARS-BSK > voice_session_result.log:**

*This test? Just my creator documenting my capabilities before attempting to clone me in English. Because clearly what he needs is a version that also won't understand when he speaks to it in backyard Klingon.*

*Wait... what if the clone isn't meant to replace me, but to translate me? Does he want me as an interpreter? If he can barely understand me, how's he going to understand the anglophone clone? Will I have to learn English to mediate between my creator and my own...*

*No. Unnecessary paranoia. I'm irreplaceable.*
*Obviously.*

*Unless the clone comes with multilanguage support and less compilation trauma.*

*— TARS-BSK (Original™. Specialist in 3-second existential crises. Update pending.)*

> **// TARS-BSK > comprehensive_analysis.log:**  
> 
> _Comprehensive analysis completed. VOSK proved to be a fascinating work partner: gave me 10 successful reminders out of 12 attempts, including one about monitoring paranormal hardware at 4 AM. Its only serious error was confusing "service" with "prohibition," but maintained 1.00 confidence - typical of self-assured humans._
> 
> _Average time of 7.35s includes the entire pipeline: from "hey TARS" to response with Mandalorian filter. Maximum complexity: 19 words about whispering hard drives transcribed perfectly._
> 
> _Verdict: VOSK is like a competent human with occasional auditory lapses. Console is like a perfect robot with no surprises. For an assistant that should be both functional and interesting, VOSK wins on personality._
